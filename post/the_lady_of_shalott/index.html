        <meta property="og:description" content="&#34;The Lady of Shalott&#34; is a romantic poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.  Like other early poems— &#34;Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere,&#34; and &#34;Galahad&#34;— the poem recasts Arthurian subject matter loosely based on medieval sources and takes up some themes that would become more fully realized in &#34;Idylls of the King&#34; where the tale of &#34;Elaine of Astolat&#34; is recounted." />

<h2 id="part-i">Part I</h2>

<p>On either side the river lie<br />
Long fields of barley and of rye,<br />
That clothe the wold and meet the sky;<br />
And through the field the road runs by<br />
To many-towered Camelot;<br />
And up and down the people go,<br />
Gazing where the lilies blow<br />
Round an island there below,<br />
The island of Shalott.</p>

<p>Willows whiten, aspens quiver,<br />
Little breezes dusk and shiver<br />
Through the wave that runs for ever<br />
By the island in the river<br />
Flowing down to Camelot.<br />
Four grey walls, and four grey towers,<br />
Overlook a space of flowers,<br />
And the silent isle imbowers<br />
The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>By the margin, willow-veiled,<br />
Slide the heavy barges trailed<br />
By slow horses; and unhailed<br />
The shallop flitteth silken-sailed<br />
Skimming down to Camelot:<br />
But who hath seen her wave her hand?<br />
Or at the casement seen her stand?<br />
Or is she known in all the land,<br />
The Lady of Shalott?</p>

<p>Only reapers, reaping early<br />
In among the bearded barley,<br />
Hear a song that echoes cheerly<br />
From the river winding clearly,<br />
Down to towered Camelot:<br />
And by the moon the reaper weary,<br />
Piling sheaves in uplands airy,<br />
Listening, whispers &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the fairy<br />
Lady of Shalott.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="part-ii">Part II</h2>

<p>There she weaves by night and day<br />
A magic web with colours gay.<br />
She has heard a whisper say,<br />
A curse is on her if she stay<br />
To look down to Camelot.<br />
She knows not what the curse may be,<br />
And so she weaveth steadily,<br />
And little other care hath she,<br />
The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>And moving through a mirror clear<br />
That hangs before her all the year,<br />
Shadows of the world appear.<br />
There she sees the highway near<br />
Winding down to Camelot:<br />
There the river eddy whirls,<br />
And there the surly village-churls,<br />
And the red cloaks of market girls,<br />
Pass onward from Shalott.</p>

<p>Sometimes a troop of damsels glad,<br />
An abbot on an ambling pad,<br />
Sometimes a curly shepherd-lad,<br />
Or long-haired page in crimson clad,<br />
Goes by to towered Camelot;<br />
And sometimes through the mirror blue<br />
The knights come riding two and two:<br />
She hath no loyal knight and true,<br />
The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>But in her web she still delights<br />
To weave the mirror&rsquo;s magic sights,<br />
For often through the silent nights<br />
A funeral, with plumes and lights<br />
And music, went to Camelot:<br />
Or when the moon was overhead,<br />
Came two young lovers lately wed;<br />
&ldquo;I am half sick of shadows,&rdquo; said<br />
The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<h2 id="part-iii">Part III</h2>

<p>A bow-shot from her bower-eaves,<br />
He rode between the barley-sheaves,<br />
The sun came dazzling through the leaves,<br />
And flamed upon the brazen greaves<br />
Of bold Sir Lancelot.<br />
A red-cross knight for ever kneeled<br />
To a lady in his shield,<br />
That sparkled on the yellow field,<br />
Beside remote Shalott.</p>

<p>The gemmy bridle glittered free,<br />
Like to some branch of stars we see<br />
Hung in the golden Galaxy.<br />
The bridle bells rang merrily<br />
As he rode down to Camelot:<br />
And from his blazoned baldric slung<br />
A mighty silver bugle hung,<br />
And as he rode his armour rung,<br />
Beside remote Shalott.</p>

<p>All in the blue unclouded weather<br />
Thick-jewelled shone the saddle-leather,<br />
The helmet and the helmet-feather<br />
Burned like one burning flame together,<br />
As he rode down to Camelot.<br />
As often through the purple night,<br />
Below the starry clusters bright,<br />
Some bearded meteor, trailing light,<br />
Moves over still Shalott.</p>

<p>His broad clear brow in sunlight glowed;<br />
On burnished hooves his war-horse trode;<br />
From underneath his helmet flowed<br />
His coal-black curls as on he rode,<br />
As he rode down to Camelot.<br />
From the bank and from the river<br />
He flashed into the crystal mirror,<br />
&ldquo;Tirra lirra,&rdquo; by the river<br />
Sang Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>She left the web, she left the loom,<br />
She made three paces through the room,<br />
She saw the water-lily bloom,<br />
She saw the helmet and the plume,<br />
She looked down to Camelot.<br />
Out flew the web and floated wide;<br />
The mirror cracked from side to side;<br />
&ldquo;The curse is come upon me,&rdquo; cried<br />
The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<h2 id="part-iv">Part IV</h2>

<p>In the stormy east-wind straining,<br />
The pale yellow woods were waning,<br />
The broad stream in his banks complaining,<br />
Heavily the low sky raining<br />
Over towered Camelot;<br />
Down she came and found a boat<br />
Beneath a willow left afloat,<br />
And round about the prow she wrote<br />
The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>And down the river&rsquo;s dim expanse,<br />
Like some bold seer in a trance<br />
Seeing all his own mischance,<br />
With a glassy countenance<br />
Did she look to Camelot.<br />
And at the closing of the day<br />
She loosed the chain, and down she lay;<br />
The broad stream bore her far away,<br />
The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>Lying, robed in snowy white<br />
That loosely flew to left and right—<br />
The leaves upon her falling light—<br />
Through the noises of the night<br />
She floated down to Camelot:<br />
And as the boat-head wound along<br />
The willowy hills and fields among,<br />
They heard her singing her last song,<br />
The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>Heard a carol, mournful, holy,<br />
Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,<br />
Till her blood was frozen slowly,<br />
And her eyes were darkened wholly,<br />
Turned to towered Camelot.<br />
For ere she reached upon the tide<br />
The first house by the water-side,<br />
Singing in her song she died,<br />
The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>Under tower and balcony,<br />
By garden-wall and gallery,<br />
A gleaming shape she floated by,<br />
Dead-pale between the houses high,<br />
Silent into Camelot.<br />
Out upon the wharfs they came,<br />
Knight and burgher, lord and dame,<br />
And round the prow they read her name,<br />
The Lady of Shalott.</p>

<p>Who is this? and what is here?<br />
And in the lighted palace near<br />
Died the sound of royal cheer;<br />
And they crossed themselves for fear,<br />
All the knights at Camelot:<br />
But Lancelot mused a little space;<br />
He said, &ldquo;She has a lovely face;<br />
God in his mercy lend her grace,<br />
The Lady of Shalott.&rdquo;</p>
